Park-Finder
===========

Javascript application using Google Maps API to find parks near a specified location.

-------------

The final, stable bits are index.html and park-finder.js

To play with them, make sure they are in the same directory. If you play with this from a local machine rather 
than out on the web, know that Chrome (as of July 23, 2012) will not support automatic location detection.

Future Improvements
-------------------
Detailed infowindow with open times, rating, and links to a website, if any
A text list of nearby parks in addition to map view
An option to view images of parks from Google street view
